ABOUT THE SYSTEM:

First, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data. This will help you to better understand what types of recommendations you can make and how to improve your system.

Second, build the recommendation system. Use the insights from EDA to inform your design decisions so that you can build a more robust system that can make accurate recommendations in a variety of situations.

Finally, get recommendations! Test your system by trying out different combinations of movies and users until you find ones that work well together.
